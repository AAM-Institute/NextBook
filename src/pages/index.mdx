!> Use Right Tool For The Job NextBook is not geared towards API documentation, rather it is optimised for tutorial/book style documentation. For API docs [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or plain [Spinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) would be a better fit.
