**NextBook** is quick and easy way to buid technical books or documentation that support modern standards and run blazingly fast. It works by compiling markdown or MDX to static pages. This way, first content render on user's device is near instant.

NextBook makes writing technical docs stupid simple while keeping featureset minimal: 

1. Create markdown content files in `pages` folder 
1. Update table of contents 

... and voila 🎉! This should be enough to have a statically generated documentation page or book.

With the advantages of [Next.js](https://nextjs.com), anything fancy (grading, level switching, you name it..) can be added along the way.
